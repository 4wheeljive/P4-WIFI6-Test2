/// @brief   Expands a grid using bilinear interpolation for upscaling effects
///
/// This effect wrapper allows rendering at a lower resolution and then scaling up
/// to the display resolution using bilinear interpolation. This is useful for:
/// - Underpowered devices that can't handle full resolution rendering
/// - Dynamic resolution scaling when grid size changes
/// - Optimizing performance by rendering complex effects at lower resolution

/// @note To override FASTLED_SCALE_UP, it must be defined via build system flags (e.g.,
///       platformio.ini with `build_flags = -DFASTLED_SCALE_UP=0`). Including it in source
///       files will not work as this header will already be included. This optimization is
///       only necessary for sketches at maximum memory capacity; normal usage does not
///       require overriding the default DECIDE_AT_RUNTIME mode.

/// @brief Optimized for power-of-2 grid sizes (fastest, lowest memory)
/// Uses bit-shifting operations for division. Ideal for AVR and other memory-constrained
/// devices when grid dimensions are powers of 2 (e.g., 8x8, 16x16, 32x32).

/// @brief Runtime selection based on grid size (adaptive)
/// Uses more executable memory as both POWER_OF_2 and HIGH_PRECISION implementations
/// are compiled in. Automatically selects the faster power-of-2 algorithm when applicable,
/// otherwise falls back to high-precision mode.
